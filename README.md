# LVRNet
*AAAI 2023 Student Abstract and Poster Program Submission*

LVRNet, short for Low-Visibility Restoration Network, is a method that can effectively recover 
high-quality images from degraded images taken in poor visual conditions. Although we have tested 
our work for two degrading factors combined: low-light and haze, you can use this codebase
and run experiments for other degrading factors as well using the instructions given below.
If you're interested in this work, please check our webpage for more information.


## Method Overview


## Quick Start

### 1. Install Environment
`git clone \\
cd LVRNet \\
pip install -r requirements.txt`

### 2. Download Dataset
We have used publically available dataset AFO <insert link> and generated our dataset - *Low-Vis AFO*, by adding
low visibility conditions. You can download it here <insert link>.

For a quick demo, you can use our pretrained weights and run them on a demo images using `demo.ipynb`.
  
### 3. Reproducing the results
  `python train.py`

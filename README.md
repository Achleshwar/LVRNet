LVRNet, short for Low-Visibility Restoration Network, is a method that can effectively recover 
high-quality images from degraded images taken in poor visual conditions. Although we have tested 
our work for two degrading factors combined: low-light and haze, you can use this codebase
and run experiments for other degrading factors as well using the instructions given below.


## Method Overview

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Environment

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Achleshwar/lvrnet.git
cd lvrnet 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Download Dataset
We have used public [dataset AFO](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jangsienicajzkowy/afo-aerial-dataset-of-floating-objects) and generated our dataset - `Low-Vis AFO`, by adding
low visibility conditions. You can download it [here]().

### 3. Demo using pretrained Weights
For a quick demo, you can use our pretrained weights and run them on a demo images using `src/lvrnet-notebook.ipynb`.

Download the pretrained weights from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TxelsYpuSfNcGphlaal1r2EfL64uALBE/view?usp=sharing) and change `model_wts` path in the notebook.
  
### 4. Reproducing the results
```shell
## train from scratch
python train.py --epochs 50 --data_dir <path to dataset> --log_dir <path to save weights> --perloss --edgeloss --fftloss
```
